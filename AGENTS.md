# Agent Guidelines

These rules apply to the whole repository.

## Project Naming

- Use `Sheepfold` as the main project and product name in English and Russian text.
- Use `Овчарня` only when referring to the Android app name or the Russian LuCI display name.
- Do not use `Овчарня` as the generic Russian name for the whole project outside direct app/interface naming.

Correct examples:

- `Sheepfold — система семейного управления доступом...`
- `Android-приложение: Овчарня`
- `LuCI RU: Овчарня : контроль доступа в интернет для семьи`

Avoid:

- `Овчарня — система...`
- `Если Овчарня окажется полезной...`

## User-Facing Wording

- Prefer clear router-based wording over internal-only LuCI wording.
- In Russian, write `через OpenWRT-роутер и его веб-интерфейс LuCI` instead of only `через LuCI`.
- Keep README files approachable for non-developers.
- Keep user-facing strings localizable. Do not hardcode menu labels, validation messages, or bot replies when a localization resource should be used.

## README Layout

- Keep installation, update, and uninstall instructions near the top of both `README.md` and `README.ru.md`, before long product explanations.
- Keep the English and Russian README files structurally similar where practical.
- Keep `install.sh`, `update.sh`, and `uninstall.sh` suitable for running directly on an OpenWRT router.
- The uninstall command must remove the package without clearing Sheepfold client lists or user settings, then print a report of remaining router settings that may require manual cleanup.
- When changing installation, update, or uninstall commands, update both README files and `docs/github-install-setup.md` if relevant.

## Implementation Entry Point

- Future AI developers should start with `docs/developer-task.ru.md`, then read `docs/product-requirements.md` and the relevant focused docs.
- Keep `docs/developer-task.ru.md` updated when project-level decisions change.
- Do not replace the focused docs with the developer task; it is an entrypoint and summary, not the source of every detail.

## Emergency-Useful Sites

- The user-facing feature name is:
  - RU: `Доступ к аварийно-полезным сайтам`
  - EN: `Access to emergency-useful sites`
- Do not call this feature `белый список доменов` in user-facing Russian UI copy.
- Use one editable domain list, not built-in presets. AdGuard Home already has filtering presets; Sheepfold should not duplicate them.
- Every automatically suggested site entry must include:
  - domain;
  - user-visible display name;
  - short explanation of why the site may be needed;
  - optional warning;
  - source, for example `starter`, `manual`, `imported`, or `integration`.
- Emergency-useful sites are for restricted access: enough for necessary services, not enough for normal entertainment browsing.
- Emergency-useful sites may be allowed for blocklisted devices only through a separate explicit setting. This must not grant access to LuCI, SSH, or Sheepfold API.
- Do not add marketplaces, shopping services, super-app storefronts, food delivery catalogs, entertainment catalogs, app stores, or broad "everything" portals to default, starter, auto-generated, auto-imported, or "safe minimum" emergency-useful sites lists.

## Yandex Domains

- Do not add broad `yandex.ru` to any default, starter, auto-generated, auto-imported, or "safe minimum" emergency-useful sites list.
- Do not silently include broad Yandex domains when creating examples, onboarding defaults, first-run suggestions, import templates, generated configs, tests, fixtures, or screenshots.
- If Yandex search is needed by default, prefer `ya.ru`.
- If maps are needed by default, prefer `2gis.ru`.
- Add broad Yandex domains only when the parent/admin explicitly adds them manually or selects an advanced option with a clear warning.
- Always explain the reason: broad Yandex domains can open much more than maps or search, including video, music, games, feeds, entertainment pages, and other Yandex services. Yandex Maps may require shared Yandex/static domains, so narrow allowance can be difficult.
- Yandex Go, Yandex Taxi, Yandex Market, Yandex Food, Yandex Lavka, Yandex Delivery, and similar Yandex super-app surfaces must not be added to default emergency-useful site lists. They may be offered only as manually enabled transport/taxi suggestions with a clear warning that Yandex Go can also expose marketplace, food, delivery, carsharing, scooter, and other non-emergency services.

## User Agreement And Privacy

- Keep the full Russian user agreement in `docs/user-agreement.ru.md`.
- Keep `docs/user-agreement.md` as the English routing/summary document until a full English legal text is prepared.
- Keep the full Russian privacy policy in `docs/privacy.ru.md`.
- Keep `docs/privacy.md` as the English routing/summary document until a full English privacy policy is prepared.
- Android first setup must require a checkbox before use: `Я принимаю пользовательское соглашение и даю согласие на обработку персональных и технических данных, необходимых для работы Sheepfold.`
- OpenWRT installer must show a link to the full agreement and require explicit `yes`, `y`, or `да` input before applying installation or configuration changes.
- The agreement must be visible before first use in LuCI/Android when practical.
- Do not claim that the agreement is final legal advice; production releases should be reviewed by a qualified lawyer.
- Sheepfold is self-hosted for family use by default. Do not introduce a developer-operated cloud dependency unless explicitly requested later.
- Android is for parent/admin devices only; do not design hidden child-phone installation flows.
- If app-store publication is added later, prepare store-specific privacy disclosures before release.

## Messaging

- Telegram and VK are both two-way chat/control channels.
- VK is the default first-run messenger choice.
- Keep `active` disabled until the parent/admin enters valid credentials and binds at least one approved administrator.
- MAX remains an experimental adapter, not a first-release requirement.
- A router can enable only one messenger adapter at a time: Telegram, VK, or experimental MAX.
- Do not design flows that require multiple messenger adapters to be active simultaneously on the same router.
- Messenger integrations must use the same Sheepfold API as LuCI and Android.
- Messenger access must be bound to explicitly approved parent/admin users configured on the router.
- On OpenWRT, prefer outbound HTTPS long polling for Telegram instead of webhooks, so the router does not need an inbound public HTTPS endpoint.
- If MAX is implemented, keep it clearly marked as experimental until current public MAX Bot API behavior is confirmed for router-side use.
- Administrative bot actions such as reboot, update, import, global block, and list changes must require explicit confirmation.

## Administrators And Roles

- Minimum roles are `owner` and `admin`.
- `owner` can manage administrators; `admin` can manage family internet rules but must not remove the owner.
- Do not add child/client roles or child-facing control interfaces unless explicitly requested later.
- Administrative logs should record who changed what, when, and with what result, without storing secrets.

## Device Defaults

- New device behavior is configurable: `allow` by default, or `restrict_until_configured`.
- Global "Block internet" blocks every device except allowlisted devices.
- Device groups should include children, parents, TVs/media devices, and guests/custom groups.
- Offline known devices should be cleaned after a configurable number of inactive days; default is 90 days.
- Blocked-page placeholder text must be configurable by the parent/admin.

## Wi-Fi Settings

- Sheepfold may expose common 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz Wi-Fi settings: SSID, password, security mode, and channel.
- Wi-Fi changes must require confirmation because the current admin may be disconnected.
- Do not hide or replace standard OpenWRT wireless pages; Sheepfold only provides a simpler family-facing shortcut.
- Do not add guest-network features unless explicitly requested again.

## LuCI Browser Cache

- LuCI frontend assets must use one cache-busting version value.
- The canonical source is the OpenWRT package version: `PKG_VERSION-PKG_RELEASE`.
- The package Makefile should expose it as `SHEEPFOLD_UI_ASSET_VERSION` and write it to `ui_asset_version` during install/update.
- Default UCI may expose this as `ui_asset_version`, but individual JS/CSS files must not hardcode their own versions.
- Append the same version to Sheepfold JS/CSS/static asset URLs as a query suffix such as `?v=0.1.0-1`.
- Bump the package version/release when LuCI frontend files change.
- Keep manual browser-cache clearing as troubleshooting, not the normal update path.
- Clear LuCI index/module cache from install/update hooks when the menu or LuCI view structure changes.

## LuCI Architecture

- Use a Podkop-like structure for the real LuCI implementation: a small entrypoint with `form.Map("sheepfold")`, `tabbed = true`, and separate modules for devices, allowlist, blocklist, schedules, emergency-useful sites, Wi-Fi, integrations, messaging, logs, diagnostics, and settings.
- Keep the visual prototype separate from the future production architecture; do not keep growing one huge `overview.js`.
- LuCI must call a narrow backend command/API layer such as `/usr/bin/sheepfold <method>` instead of building arbitrary shell commands.
- rpcd ACL must explicitly allow only the Sheepfold files, UCI configs, ubus objects, and executable commands required by the UI.
- Put diagnostics in a dedicated tab and return structured JSON for checks.

## Export And Backup

- Default export must be readable JSON/archive without secrets.
- Full export with bot tokens, API keys, sessions, passwords, or other secrets must require encrypted export with a password.

## Schedules

- Schedules apply only to devices that are not in the allowlist or blocklist.
- Temporary access may override a schedule, but must never override the blocklist.
- Schedule UI must support weekdays, time ranges, enabled/disabled state, allow/block actions, and intervals crossing midnight.
- Temporary access quick buttons are +15 minutes, +30 minutes, +1 hour, +2 hours, +3 hours, +5 hours, until end of day, and until bedtime.
- If schedule rules conflict, show a warning and keep backend behavior deterministic.

## AdGuard Home And Podkop Integrations

- The LuCI setting is `Use together with` / `Использование совместно с`.
- Supported integration modes are `none`, `adguard`, `podkop`, and `adguard_podkop`.
- Do not model AdGuard Home and Podkop as mutually exclusive; they can be used together.
- The installer must detect existing AdGuard Home and Podkop installations and choose the matching Sheepfold `integration_mode`.
- Show integration-specific notes before applying changes.
- Automatic router changes require explicit confirmation and should create/export a backup first.
- Automatic install-time changes may write only Sheepfold-owned UCI options unless the user explicitly confirms broader router changes.
- Do not overwrite AdGuard Home or Podkop configs blindly.
- Do not modify Podkop-managed Dnsmasq, nftables, sing-box, or routing state unless the change is explicitly designed and documented.

## Localization

- Russian is the primary product wording source.
- English is the required fallback language.
- Translation files are small; keep them in the repository/package by default instead of downloading them separately.
- Planned generated UI languages include Spanish, German, French, Portuguese (Brazil), Italian, Polish, Turkish, Ukrainian, Chinese Simplified, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Hindi, Indonesian, and Vietnamese.

## AI Assistant And Country Profiles

- The Android parent assistant must use an abstract provider layer. Do not hardcode DeepSeek or any other provider as the only global option.
- DeepSeek can be the preferred default provider only in country profiles where it is allowed and reachable.
- Provider availability is country-profile configuration, not a permanent legal claim in code.
- The selected router country controls visible AI providers and suggested emergency-useful sites.
- Manual user entries must survive country changes.
- AI context sharing must use an explicit preview/confirmation step. Do not send MAC/IP/device names/child names/family details/logs/device lists/router settings automatically.
- The assistant may suggest settings but must not apply router actions without explicit parent confirmation.
- Keep long assistant prompts in separate prompt documents, not buried inside architecture docs.
- Assistant prompts are drafts until reviewed by the project owner and, for family/psychology guidance, a qualified family psychologist.

## Android App Security Copy

- During first setup, Android app local authentication should recommend password or PIN.
- Fingerprint and face unlock may be offered, but should not be described as the safest default for a parental-control app.
- Use concise wording: biometric unlock can be less safe because a child may try to unlock the app while the parent is asleep.

## Platform Scope

- Target modern OpenWRT with `firewall4` / `nftables`.
- Do not add legacy `firewall3` / `iptables` support unless explicitly requested later.
- Target Android 9.0 Pie / API 28 and newer.

## Repository Hygiene

- Keep `README.md` in English.
- Keep `README.ru.md` in Russian.
- Keep shell scripts and OpenWRT package files LF-only.
- Do not commit secrets, tokens, router passwords, or local environment files.
